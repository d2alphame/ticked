= Ticked

== This is H2

Ticked is a markdown-like lightweight markup language. But why, you may ask.
Why would you create yet another dialect of markdown? The answer is simple
really because I want to, and because I can. :D

= Headers

Headers are prefixed with the equals sign (=). The number of equals sign
determines the heading level. For example:

= This is H1

== This is H2

=== This is H3
